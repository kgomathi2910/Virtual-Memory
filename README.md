# Virtual-Memory

1. Page Replacement Algorithms

- Implemented different page replacement algorithms like FIFO, LFU, LRU and Second Chance algorithms
- Compared their performances and calculated the number of page faults generated for each algorithm

2. Address Translation

- Translated virtual address to physical address
- List of virtual addresses (logical address) in ‘address.txt’.
- Calculated TLB hit / TLB miss and PAGE TABLE hit / PAGE TABLE miss
